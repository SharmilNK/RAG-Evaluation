evaluate_rag_node.py — LangGraph Node: RAG Evaluation
======================================================
This node runs after score_kpis and before aggregate_report.
It calls eval_rag.run_all_evaluations() using the KPI results and sources
already present in pipeline state, then stores the structured results
back into state under the key "rag_evaluation".

The evaluate_rag_node does NOT modify any KPI scores or rationales.
It only measures quality and appends evaluation metadata to the report.

Pipeline position:
    score_kpis → [evaluate_rag] → aggregate_report
