eval_rag.py — RAG Evaluation Module
=====================================
This file checks how well the AI system is finding, using, and reporting
information about a company's AI maturity.


Nine checks are run:
    1. RAGAS Evaluation         — Overall pipeline quality score (industry standard).
                                  Faithfulness, Answer Relevance, Context Precision and Recall 
                                  
                                 
    2. LLM as a Judge           — A second AI reviews each answer for quality
    3. Recall@k                 — Were the most useful sources in the top results?
    4. F1 Score                 — How much overlap is there between answer and evidence?
    5. Hallucination Check      — Did the AI say things not backed by evidence?
    6. MMR (Diversity Check)    — Did the system pull from varied sources, not just similar ones?


Ground truth strategy:
    Checks (Factual Correctness ,Noise Sensitivity,Semantic Similarity) require a reference "ideal answer" to compare against.
    Rather than writing these manually, we extract the Score-5 rubric description
    from kpis.yaml for each KPI. This describes what a top-scoring answer looks like
    (e.g. "Clear, coherent AI strategy with priorities and outcomes.") and serves
    as the benchmark the AI's actual answer is measured against.

How to use:
    from eval_rag import run_all_evaluations
    run_all_evaluations(kpi_results, sources, kpi_definitions)

Where RAG report scores come from (when LLM/ragas is not used):
----------------------------------------------------------------
These metrics appear in report YAML under rag_evaluation. When the OpenAI API
is unavailable (e.g. 429) or ragas is not installed, values come from local
fallbacks in this file — no LLM is called.

  • ragas_context_precision
    Fallback: evaluate_ragas() local approximation (lines ~253–268).
    Formula: For each retrieved context chunk, (question_tokens ∩ chunk_tokens) / len(chunk_tokens);
             then average over chunks. Low = retrieved text shares few words with the question.

  • ragas_context_recall
    Fallback: same block. Formula: (ground_truth_tokens ∩ context_tokens) / len(ground_truth_tokens).
    Ground truth = Score-5 rubric text from kpis.yaml. Fraction of "ideal" words found in evidence.

  • hallucination_score / hallucination_flagged
    Fallback: evaluate_hallucination() heuristic (lines ~585–633). Always runs first.
    Formula: Split answer into sentences;              if <20% of a sentence's words appear in evidence,
             count as "unsupported". heuristic_score = unsupported_sentences / total_sentences.
    If LLM layer is skipped (no key or _call_llm fails), final_score = heuristic_score.
    hallucination_flagged = (final_score > threshold), default threshold 0.4.

  • mmr_diversity_score
    No LLM. evaluate_mmr() (lines ~702–819) uses only _simple_embedding() (hash-based 64-d vector)
    and _cosine_similarity(). Formula: MMR re-ranks chunks; diversity_score = 1.0 - avg_redundancy,
    where avg_redundancy is mean pairwise cosine similarity of selected chunks. High = diverse sources.

  • semantic_similarity
    No LLM in fallback. evaluate_ragas_with_ground_truth() local path (lines ~965–973).
    Formula: answer_vec = _simple_embedding(answer), gt_vec = _simple_embedding(ground_truth);
             raw = cosine_similarity(answer_vec, gt_vec); semantic_similarity = (raw + 1) / 2 (scale to 0–1).
    Measures hash-based similarity between answer and Score-5 rubric text.

    Checks whether the AI's answer contains claims that are NOT supported

    makes up or assumes information that isn't in the source material.

    Two-layer check:
      Layer 1 (always runs): Word-overlap heuristic
        — Splits the answer into sentences and checks each one against the evidence.
        — A sentence is "unsupported" if very few of its words appear in any evidence chunk.
        — Hallucination score = fraction of answer sentences that are unsupported.

      Layer 2 (runs if LLM available): LLM verification
        — Asks a second AI to read the evidence and the answer, then flag any
          claims in the answer that cannot be found or inferred from the evidence.
        — More accurate than word overlap alone.

    it describes what an excellent, top-scoring answer to this KPI looks like.
    It is NOT a confirmed factual statement about the company; it is a quality benchmark.

    The three checks:

    CHECK 7 — FACTUAL CORRECTNESS
        Breaks both the AI's answer and the ground truth into individual claims.
        Then checks: how many claims in the answer match claims in the ground truth?
        This is more precise than word-level F1 because it works at the meaning level.
        Score 0-1. Higher = the answer's claims align well with what "good" looks like.

    CHECK 8 — NOISE SENSITIVITY
        Measures whether thin, irrelevant, or boilerplate sources (Tier 3 pages)
        caused the AI to give an incorrect or misleading answer.
        A high noise sensitivity score means the AI was misled by poor sources.
        Score 0-1. LOWER is better (less sensitive to noise = more robust).

    CHECK 9 — SEMANTIC SIMILARITY
        Uses word embeddings to compare the overall meaning of the answer
        against the ground truth. Unlike F1, this captures paraphrasing and
        synonyms — two sentences can mean the same thing even with different words.
        Score 0-1. Higher = the answer means roughly the same as the ideal answer.

    All three attempt to use the ragas library first (pip install ragas).
    If ragas is not installed, they fall back to local approximations.
